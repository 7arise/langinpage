# 🎿 SkiiRentals – Landing Page Practice Project

![Preview](./screenshot.png)

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a **practice landing page** built entirely with **HTML5 and CSS3**, created to improve my front-end layout and design skills.  
It represents a fictional ski rental service called **SkiiRentals**, featuring a clean, modern, and minimalistic design inspired by real-world product landing pages.

The goal of this project was to **practice responsive design, Flexbox, CSS Grid, component structure, and visual hierarchy**, while maintaining a consistent color palette and typography.
